# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  – About 3-4 hours.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  – It took me some time to get the idea about using modules, it can be confusing at first :)

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  – I added a method to find an item in a list and I created this because I thought I'm going to need it for the feature I had in mind which being able to update priority, but after finishing it I realized that I won't be needing it, and I did the update priority feature because it was one of the features listed by you guys :) my final and third feature, which is 'Add priority to all item types' I added it because it made implementing my 2nd feature easier.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  – I'm not sure, I think with each project I finish I learn new things and grow a bit more, so keep 'em coming ;)
